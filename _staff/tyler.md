bio: I am a Senior 0.5'er studying CS. Outside of class, you can find me working the circulation desk at a few of the libraries across campus or stage managing a production for the TAPS department. As someone whose bad music taste has not advanced beyond 2014, I am excited that the best bops of this millennia have begun to enter their retro phase.
